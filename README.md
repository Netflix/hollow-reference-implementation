Clone this project, import it into your IDE, then follow along with the [quick start guide](http://hollow.how/quick-start) — you'll have a demo up and running in minutes, and a fully production-scalable implementation of Hollow at your fingertips in about an hour.  From there, you can plug in your data model and it's off to the races.
